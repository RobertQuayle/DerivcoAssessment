For Question Two, I started off by taking a step back and analysing what was being asked of me. The requirements, the constraints and then wrote down a high-level overview on my notepad (bullet-points).

Apart from the "Scope" which was defined in the question's wording, the only other requirement/constraint that I could seem to think of was the fact that within a deck, it should be impossible to deal the exact same card twice, value & set.

So with all this in mind I headed to my whiteboard to visualize how I was going to make this work. I started by considering the four pillars of Object Orientated Development: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance & Polymorphism.

Based off the Scope and question wording, I determined that what was mainly being asked of me was to create something polymorphic, while abstracting where possible.

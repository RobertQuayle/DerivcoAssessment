Derivco Technical Assessment - Robert Cameron Quayle 03/04/2022

Below is a detailed overview of useful information regarding my assessment.

Just want to mention, incase this assessment is being timed, that I probably could of completed this sooner however I was in London over the weekend when it was sent and I work during the day.

Would also just like to say to anyone reading this, regardless if I make it to the next round of the interviewing process or not, I would really appriciate any feedback that you might have to help improve my code, that's worth its weight in gold and I thank you in advance!

Many thanks!
Cameron.

<h3>Question 2: Usage Guide</h3>
To play HighCard firstly you must create a new game instance like so:

```C#
HighCard name = new();
```

You can use parameters to alter how the game plays. There are 5 parameters with the types as shown below in order:

```C#
HighCard name = new(string[] range, string[] sets, bool compareSets, bool noTie, bool wildcard);
```

All parameters are optional, you can create an instance of HighCard with all or no parameters:

```C#
HighCard gameOne = new();
HighCard gameTwo = new(range, sets, true, true, true);
```

NOTE: To skip range/sets parameters, use Null as the input, it will be ignored. Any missing paramaters will be set to default:

```C#
// Bool params are set to default as only two are declared:
HighCard gameOne = new(range, sets);

// Range & Sets params are ignored and Bool params are declared:
HighCard gameTwo = new(null, null, true, true, true);
```

When ready to play, simply invoke the instance of HighCard you created sith the Play() method like so:

```C#
HighCard game = new();

game.Play();
```
